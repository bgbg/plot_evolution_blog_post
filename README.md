# Evolution of a plot -- better data visualization, one step at a time


This notebook contains the code that accompanies my blog post on http://data.blog. The notebook and the post demonstrate iterative improvement of a single plot. See the blog post for more details. Feel free asking questions and suggesting improvements. See the full post [here](http://wp.me/p7OQzv-7b).

The repository structure is as follows:

* evolution_of_a_plot.ipynb -- the main notebook with the code
* data/ -- csv data files, manually created from the information available in the Wikipedia.
