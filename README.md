# Evolution of a plot -- better data visualization, one step at a time

This repository contains the code that accompanies my blog post on http://data.blog. It demonstrates iterative improvement of a single plot. See the blog post for more details. Feel free asking questions and suggesting improvements.

The repository structure is as follows:

* evolution_of_a_plot.ipynb -- the main notebook with the code
* data/ -- csv data files, manually created from the information available in the Wikipedia.
